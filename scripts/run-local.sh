# Convenience launcher for single-host setups (server and client on the same
# machine). Starts the server in the background, waits for its WebSocket port
# to come up, then runs the client in the foreground; the server is killed
# when the client exits. Split-host deployments should keep starting each
# package independently — see docs/INSTALLATION.md. Windows equivalent:
# run-local.ps1.
