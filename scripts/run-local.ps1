# Convenience launcher for single-host setups (server and client on the same
# machine). Starts the server as a background job, waits for its WebSocket port
# to come up, then runs the client in the foreground; the server is stopped
# when the client exits. Split-host deployments should keep starting each
# package independently — see docs/INSTALLATION.md.
#
# Requires `uv sync` to have succeeded in server/, which on Windows needs a
# C/C++ compiler installed first — see docs/INSTALLATION.md's "Server: C++
# Build Tools (Windows)" section.
