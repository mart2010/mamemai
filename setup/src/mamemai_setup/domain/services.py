    is `None` when GPUDetector could not read NVIDIA/CUDA VRAM specifically —
    this includes AMD GPUs, which GPUDetector never measures (see gpu.py) but
    which Ollama still detects and uses on its own for the LLM. So None means
    "this sizing estimate is unavailable," not "no GPU will be used" — treated
    as TIGHT with a warning rather than blocking the choice outright.
    `reserved_gb` is whatever else needs to run alongside this component (see
    the two module constants above) — kept explicit rather than hardcoded so
    this function works for both LLM and Whisper-model-size fit checks."""
