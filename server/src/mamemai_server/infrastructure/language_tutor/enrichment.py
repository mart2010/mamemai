"""Language-tutor enrichment strategy — the first concrete PersonaEnrichmentPort.

Offline. Bundles stay the curriculum backbone; this strategy only supplements them
when consolidation shows a real interest signal: several USER-INITIATED concepts
clustering around a theme (docs/BRIEF_phase12_tutor.md — the interest-cluster
reopening). It then proposes the surrounding vocabulary cluster as UNSEEN drafts.
Exclusion of already-known material is delegated to the shared upsert-merge dedup —
proposals that duplicate existing memory merge into it instead of inserting.
